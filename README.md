Welcome to my project! It's great to have you here. üòâ 

This initiation took place at the end of learning the basics of ReactjS (it is not huge cart ptojcet, it is task), through which the products available in the store are displayed. The user can choose the category of the product he is looking for, add the products to the cart, then from the shopping cart he makes a checkout to confirm the purchase.


Skills: React.js, JSX, CSS
